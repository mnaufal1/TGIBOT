# TGIBOT

This was a Discord bot I created to help an online Model United Nations conference held on Discord. More information regarding TGIMUN can be found at the bottom of this document. This bot was developed as a summer project in 2021.

TGIBOT was created in order to facilitate multiple tasks in TGIMUN, most notably a verification system that allows all participants to verify themselves by inputting their email. This was created in order to ensure that all members in the Discord server are actual particpants and to automatically assign them their appropraite roles so that they may access their respective voice and chat channels. This is done by taking in the user's email and cross-checking it to a Google Spreadsheet containing data of all participants, such as their email, position, and committee. Other functions of the Discord bot include: clearing text and sending messsages.

This was my first time developing a Discord bot and working with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). It was an excellent learning experience to work with Discord and Google APIs and understanding how two applications may communicate and work with one another. I also had the chance to develop another Discord bot after this and experimented with various concepts such as object-oriented programming.

Overall, this project was very successful. Particpant feedback shows that the verification system was simple to use and encountered no problems.
